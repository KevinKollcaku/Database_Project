# Database_Project!
This is a school project done in teams of 6 persons. The idea behind this project was do design a database for an online contester. The database had to provide all the necessary data that an online contester had to keep track of and also fill all the requirements that the school had given us. You can see the requirements in the documentation of this project. 

## Implementation
After analyzing everything we noticed that the most basic data that we need to keep track of were: the user information, the question information and the submission information. That is why we first started with those three elements. 

We than decided to separate users into normal users and staff members. We also kept a person entity which would store the common data of both groups. 

For the submission and the question we kept it simple. We just separated a few tables where it was needed for optimization purposes and sometimes for security reasons. 	

Also during the building of the database we had to write some queries that we would think were the most necessary one. During this process we there were a few queries for which we had to implement some views. In the end we had 5 additional views.

Below here we can see the RS schema of our database:
